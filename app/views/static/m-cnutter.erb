    <b>Bio</b>: Charles Oliver Nutter has been co-lead of the JRuby project for the past four years, working on performance and Java integration, and helping to coordinate community efforts. During that time JRuby has become a premier platform for Ruby users, allowing both a gateway to Java-centric organizations as well as an excellent Ruby implementation. Charles hopes to expand JRubyâ€™s success to other JVM languages, building the JVM into the best platform for multi-language development. Charlie is employed working on JRuby full time at <a href="http://www.engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>.
