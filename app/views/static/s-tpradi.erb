    <b>Bio</b>: I am Thiago Pradi, 21, living in Jaragu√° do Sul, Brazil. I'm a Computer Science student at FURB, expecting to get graduate at 2012. I have been playing with rails since 2007 and working full-time since 2008. The projects that I did are for different areas, like Car tracking, E-commerces and other minor projects. I'm also a IPhone developer since 2009, with a published application in the App Store. but I still loving to play with Ruby and Rails. Now I'm working full-time for a brazilian company, with Ruby and Rails.
