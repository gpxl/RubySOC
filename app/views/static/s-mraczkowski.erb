    <b>Bio</b>: I've started working with Ruby three years ago, mainly thanks to Ruby on Rails, but after that I've completed several projects in both Ruby on Rails and pure Ruby. One I like most was a controller that managed mplayer instances in kiosks and retrieved rss feeds, rendered them using imagemagic and displayed them over running video using overlay and SystemV IPC.
    I've worked with a friend on ldap integration in redmine.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Recently I've completed several extensions for spree ecommerce, and contributed several patches into core(biggest one was new adjustment system).</p>
    <br />
    <p>Currently I'm working as a freelance developer.
