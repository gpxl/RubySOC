	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>To continue Google’s great tradition of sponsoring Open Source Development via summer student interns, several Ruby companies, organizations and community members are getting together to fund Ruby Summer of Code. The project will work much the same way Google Summer of Code does — mentoring organizations and student interns, only in our case, the community will vote on which mentoring organizations get slots. Students will be paid a stipend of $5000, and we’ll raise the number of student slots as contributions come in.</p>
