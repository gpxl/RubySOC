	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>To continue Google’s great tradition of sponsoring Open Source Development via summer student interns, several Ruby companies, organizations and community members are getting together to fund Ruby Summer of Code. The project will work much the same way Google Summer of Code does — mentors and student interns, with mentors voting on which student projects get slots. Students will be paid a stipend of $5000, and we’ll raise the number of student slots as contributions come in.</p>

      <h3>How does the program work?</h3>
        <p>
          The Ruby Summer of Code program is designed to help fund student development of Ruby and/or Rails projects in the summer of 2010. Accepted students will be matched up with accepted mentors and will have two months to complete their summer projects. Students will undergo a project evaluation midway through the summer (dates to be announced), and those showing suitable progress will receive 50% of their student stipend. At the close of the work window, projects will undergo final evaluations, and students who successfully completed their projects will receive the remaining 50% of their stipend. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How do evaluations work?</h3>
        <p>
          Projects will be evaluated by each student's mentor, and then reviewed by the larger mentor pool. Evaluations will be individually tailored based on the pre-determined agreed upon objectives and deliverables of each project.
